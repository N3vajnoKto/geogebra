# geogebra

Enter an expression and press ENTER to get the answer. <br />
If the calculator cannot calculate the expression, it will notify you. <br />
sign '=' does not need to be written in the expression. <br />
spaces are important. <br />
<br />
example : x ^ 2 + sin x / cos(x) + e (x * pi) <br />
<br />
Calculator can perform the following operations: <br />
a + b <br />
a - b <br />
a * b <br />
ab    <br />
a / b <br />
a ^ b  <br />
sqrt(a, b) <br />
sin(a) <br />
cos(a) <br />
tg(a) <br />
ctg(a) <br />
sec(a) <br />
csc(a) <br />
arcsin(a) <br />
arccos(a) <br />
arctg(a) <br />
arcctg(a) <br />
log(a, b)                 base a logarithm <br />
ln(a)                     natural logarithm <br />
